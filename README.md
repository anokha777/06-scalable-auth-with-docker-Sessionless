# Restful API's using Express.js

Create a Restful API for a Note taking application. You should be able to `Create`, `Read`, `Update` and `Delete` a particular note. Also, create one api to fetch all the Notes. 

- Test your API's using Postman.
- Send back proper Http status codes and error messages on invalid requests.
- Write modular code with the help of Express router.
- Create a middleware to validate the request body.
- Error Handling should be in place.
- Setup Eslint with Airbnb and resolve all lint errors and warnings.

Make sure **Note** has atleast three properties. 
 - noteId
 - noteTitle
 - noteDescription

Feel free to add more properties to the Note object as per your requirements.

CD should be configured and the API's should be deployed on Heroku.
