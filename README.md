# Assignment - Week 5

Submission date : 10th Dec

The objective is to dockerize your application, and implement scalable authentication.

## Configure Scalable Authentication using JWT

### Technical requirements
1. Dockerize your application, and write a docker-compose.yml file for starting the application and its dependencies
1. Implement a scaling mechanism for both the applications (Will be covered during Dec 6 Session)
1. For one application, use session based authentication, and for the second one, use Session-less authentication.
1. Mention the authentication details in README.md file

# Prerequisites

# Setup
1. Start by forking this repository into your account.
2. Add your 06-scalable-auth-with-docker repository as a remote with the command: `git add remote 06-scalable-auth-with-docker <insert-06-scalable-auth-with-docker-repository-url-here>`
3. Merge your 06-scalable-auth-with-docker changes into the master branch with the command: `git merge 06-scalable-auth-with-docker`. You will get a merge conflict in Readme.md file.
4. Update the Readme.md file to these instructions, and remove the instructions from 06-scalable-auth-with-docker.
5. Commit the changes. You are now ready to start working on this programming task.
